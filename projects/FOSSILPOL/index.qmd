::: {#hero-heading}

The goal of the **FOSSILPOL** project is to make it easier for the interdisciplinary researcher to work with big fossil pollen databases. We developed a paper, workflow and R-package to process multiple fossil pollen records to create a comprehensive, standardised dataset compilation, ready for multi-record and multi-proxy analyses at various spatial and temporal scales.

Our workflow is published in [Flantua et al. 2023 GEB](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.13693) where we provide a step-by-step protocol accompanied by an R-workflow **FOSSILPOL** and corresponding {`RFossilpol`} R-package for enhanced reproducibility and transparency. 

--------------------------------------------------------

We are using **FOSSILPOL** for our subprojects in the **Global human impact project** and **Pantropical Dynamics**.

Learn more about the workflow on the [project website](https://hope-uib-bio.github.io/FOSSILPOL-website/).
