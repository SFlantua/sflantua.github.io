::: {#hero-heading}

Hi! Welcome! I am Suzette Flantua (she/her).

I have a background in paleoecology, biogeography, landscape ecology, and spatial analyses, and I enjoy integrating them all to gain new insights into the drivers of global mountain biodiversity.

My research focuses on the responses of biodiversity to past and future climate change and humans, with a special emphasis on mountain systems and alpine biomes. 

I am passionate about Open Science and Outreach, and interdisciplinary, intercultural research that is truly all inclusive. I firmly believe in the power of collaborative, safe, positive, and healthy work environments in academia.
