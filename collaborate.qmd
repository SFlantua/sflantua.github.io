title: "Let's collaborate!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am passionate about Open Science and Outreach, and interdisciplinary, intercultural research that is truly all inclusive. I firmly believe in the power of collaborative, safe, positive, and healthy work environments in academia.

Do you feel the same? Would you like to come over to Bergen, or have interest to do a project with me as supervisor and collaborator? 

Feel free to reach out to me at my [UiB email](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Suzette.Geertruida.Anna.Flantua) or gmail with the naming of s.g.a.flantua.

Hope to see you in Bergen!
