This intercontinental initiative is committed to unraveling the complexities of vegetation ecosystem dynamics since the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 22 ka) using compilations of fossil pollen records.\nOur forthcoming publications include continental-scale synthesis of vegetation dynamics of Latin America, Africa, and Indo-Pacific, while we also have individual projects running as part of PhD projects.\n\n\nWe are all strongly committed to open science of our data and analysis, and we are linked to major efforts to increase the overall access to fossil pollen data globally.Therefore, we have been part of recent data mobilisation efforts across all continents to the Neotoma Paleoecology Database and all publications are and will be fully open-access with code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur work focuses on exploring Latin America’s Holocene vegetation dynamics shedding light on the complex interplay between local factors, historical contingencies, and climate change impacts on ecological systems. Over 100 collaborators are involved for upcoming papers. I am leading this project together with Ondrej Mottl and Jack Williams.\n\n\n\nThe Indo-Pacific Pollen Database (IPPD), initiated by Professor Geoffrey Hope, compiles fossil pollen records from the region, now being integrated into the Neotoma Paleoecology Database. This new compilation is currently being assessed by Annika Herbert to obtain insights into past vegetation changes, particularly in Australia, with potential for investigating human impact and Holocene vegetation dynamics. This project is in collaboration with Simon Haberle, Ondrej Mottl, Jack Williams, Adrian George, and Jessica Blois\n\n\n\nThis project focuses on understanding historical vegetation changes in African tropical ecosystems over the past 20,000 years, utilizing newly compiled pollen datasets from the African Pollen Database integrated into the Neotoma Paleoecology Database and harmonized by our R-Fossilpol package. By analyzing rates of ecosystem change through our R-Ratepol package, the study identifies periods of significant change potentially linked to climatic shifts and human activities, contributing to the preservation and conservation of these ecologically critical regions. This project is led by PhD Researcher David Early at the Ivory Paleoecology Lab lead by Sarah Ivory.\n\n\n\nOur project focuses on assessing the sensitivity of tropical ecosystems to climate change by analyzing fossil pollen records from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database. Through data retrieval and analysis, the project reveals a high sensitivity of tropical ecosystems, especially in mountainous areas, and highlights the potential impacts of 21st-century climate scenarios on plant distributions and community composition in these regions. This project is led by PhD researcher Adrian George at William’s lab.\n\n\n\nThis project aims to unravel the sensitivity of Amazonian ecosystems to climate change by utilizing fossil pollen records to reconstruct historical forest dynamics. Focusing on the Ecuador and Peru lowlands, the study employs innovative pollen-based modeling to connect changes in pollen assemblages with climatic events, shedding light on ecological responses to climate shifts and contributing to the preservation of the crucial Amazon biome. This project is led by upcoming MSCA researcher Dael Sassoon (2024-2026) supervised by Encarni Montoya."

It addresses a critical question in Earth system science - what was the impact of prehistoric people on the biosphere and its dynamics?\nThough I am no longer affiliated to the HOPE project, I am still leading several publications and I will be posting all news on the Global Human Impact project on my own account.\n\nAnthropogenic pollen indicators: global food plants and Latin American human indicators in the pollen record\n\nThis upcoming publication (Flantua & Hooghiemstra in review) provides a comprehensive overview of human presence and impact through fossil pollen records on a global scale. By identifying and analyzing various human indicators, including cultivated food plants, the study contributes valuable insights into historical ecological changes and the evolution of human societies.\n\nHuman impacts in Amazonia\n\nIn this Review, we compare rates of anthropogenic and natural environmental changes in the Amazon and South America and in the larger Earth system. We found that rates of anthropogenic processes that affect Amazonian ecosystems are up to hundreds to thousands of times faster than other natural climatic and geological phenomena. These anthropogenic changes each the scale of millions of square kilometers within just decades to centuries, as compared with millions to tens of millions of years for evolutionary, climatic, and geological processes.\nHere you can download the pdf: Albert et al. 2023 Science\n\nLogo: Created with Microsoft Bing."

    "text": "My main research interest is to understand what determines biodiversity in mountain regions, by studying the impact of climate dynamics at various time scales (past, present, future). I am particularly interested in the way how historical environmental factors (climate and geology) and humans influenced contemporary biodiversity patterns. I use a biogeographical and palaeoecological approach, taking advantage of recent developments in palaeoecological data availability (e.g. Neotoma) and landscape modelling (GIS). Most of my work has dealt with the tropics where I also have organized and participated in numerous field expeditions of the Northern and Central Andes, and savanna lowlands. I also supervise students and lecture in courses, organize scientific events, and take responsibility in committees. In addition, I am passionate about communicating my research to a broader audience through the use of video and talks about sustainability.\n\n\n\n\nDoctor of Philosophy in Biology, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands (2012-2017), Thesis ‘Climate change and topography as drivers of Latin American biome dynamics’ (23-06-2017).
